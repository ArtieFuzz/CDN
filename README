Submitting Your Final Project

To turn-in your final project, you should submit your (thoroughly documented) code along with three other files:

  A Makefile that compiles your code.
  An httpserver executable
  A dnsserver executable
  A deployCDN script
  A runCDN script
  A stopCDN script
  A plain-text (no Word or PDF) README file. In this file, you should briefly describe your high-level approach, what specific performance enhancing techniques you implemented, and any challenges you faced.

  Your README, Makefile, source code, etc. should all be placed in a directory. You submit your project by running the turn-in script as follows:

  Do not turn in files larger than 10MB, as these will be rejected.

============

# dnsserver

run with
```
./dnsserver -p <40000-65535> -n <name>
```

then test with
```
 dig @127.0.0.1 -p <40000-65535> whataver.com
```

==========================================================
<<<<<<< HEAD
http returns the page it is asked for by retrieving it from the origin. 

Http server works. Need to improve caching
=======
# httpserver
>>>>>>> f381f86367abd54ca9f5d4a070dbbdaca96dbbb1

run with
```
./httpserver -p <40000-65535> -o <origin>
```

then test with
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
curl <server>:40000-65535
```
=======
curl localhost:40000-65535
```

=====

# deployCDN
copy code to ec2 instance, run make file

# runCDN
run code on ec2 instance

# stopCDN
stop code on ec2 instance


./[deploy|run|stop]CDN -p <port> -o <origin> -n <name> -u <username> -i <keyfile>

use ssh keys as follows:

ssh -i keyfile username@<some EC2 server> ...
