At two weeks in, you need to turn in working DNS servers and caching HTTP clients. The remainder of your time will be spent on the CDN logic that links them together. This is due on November 25th, 2014 at 


DNS Server is working


run with
```
./dnsserver -p <40000-65535> -n <name>
```

then test with
```
 dig @127.0.0.1 -p <40000-65535> whataver.com
```

it should return an arbitrary ip for the given domain name

==========================================================
http returns the page it is asked for by retrieving it from the origin. 

Http server works. Need to improve caching

run with
```
./httpserver -p <40000-65535> -o <origin>
```

then test with
```
curl <server>:40000-65535
```
