At two weeks in, you need to turn in working DNS servers and caching HTTP clients. The remainder of your time will be spent on the CDN logic that links them together. This is due on November 25th, 2014 at 


dns is started, it currently can return a predefined ip address for a given domain
added hosts file  to determine location of requesting IP. Struggled to integrate in DNS server file. Also not helpful that only one node exists. 


run with
```
./dnsserver -p <40000-65535> -n <name>
```

then test with
```
 dig @127.0.0.1 -p <40000-65535> whataver.com
```

it should return an arbitrary ip for the given domain name


http is started, it currently handles get request returing the string "Welcome!"


run with
```
./httpserver -p <40000-65535> -o <origin>
```

then test with
```
curl localhost:40000-65535
```
